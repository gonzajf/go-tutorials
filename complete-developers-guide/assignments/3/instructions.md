# Assignment

Create a program that reads the content of a text file and then print its content to the terminal.  

The file to open should be provided as an argument to the program when it is executed at the terminal.  

To read in the arguments provided to a program, you can reference the variable 'os.Args', which is a slice of type string.  

To open a file, check out the documentation for the 'Open' function in the 'os' package.
